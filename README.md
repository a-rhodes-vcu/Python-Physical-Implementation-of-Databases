Hello World!

This repository contains programs written by me. These programs contain basic searching and sorting algorithm design. 

Project1.py: Sequential and Binary search that looks for each value in the query array and return true if it exists in the data array. 
Output:
false:2ms false:0ms 92
true:2ms true:0ms 89

Project2.py: Project1.py is modified to incorporate a merge sort, which is used to prep the data. 
Output:
Prep time: 45ms
false:2ms false:0ms 92
true:2ms true:0ms 89

Project3.py: Project2.py is modified once again. This program uses a basic binary tree which only inserts and searches for elements. Prep time in this example will be the time it takes to add every element to the binary tree. 
Output:
Prep time: 450ms
false:0ms 92
true:0ms 89
